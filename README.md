# Chest X-Ray Image Classification


## Overview
This repository contains a dataset of chest X-ray images for binary classification of pneumonia and normal cases. The dataset was used to train and evaluate a deep learning model for medical image classification.
The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).
## Dataset Details
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains chest X-ray images in two classes: "Pneumonia" and "Normal." The dataset is organized into three subdirectories: "train," "val" (validation), and "test," containing training, validation, and test images, respectively.

The dataset consists of chest X-ray images in two classes:
- Pneumonia: Images containing indications of pneumonia.
- Normal: Images of normal, healthy chests.
